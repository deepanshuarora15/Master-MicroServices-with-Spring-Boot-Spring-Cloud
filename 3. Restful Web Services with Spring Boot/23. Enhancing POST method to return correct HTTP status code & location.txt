1. In the POST method, we need to send an acknowledgement to client, citing the HTTP status code like 201.
   201 code is auto sent. But other stuff has to be done manually.
   We need to send the URI created.
2. @PostMapping("/users")
	public ResponseEntity<Object> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
		User savedUser = service.save(user);
		URI location = ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest().path("/{id}").buildAndExpand(savedUser.getId()).toUri();
		return ResponseEntity.created(location).build();
	}

3. The code that we wrote in last session was OK too, but the above is better. 
   HTTP status code 201 is returned which is OK for POST method.
   Also in the response -> Headers -> Location -> http://localhost:8080/users/5 
   i.e. URI of the new posted resource is also given out

4. The user can now test the above URI using GET to verify, if the user was posted correctly or not.
