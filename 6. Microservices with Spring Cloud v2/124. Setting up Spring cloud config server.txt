1. Now we would be moving to a centralized config server.
2. Create a new spring initialzr project. Create a new artifact 'spring-cloud-config-server'
3. Add dependencies:
   a. Spring Boot Dev Tools
   b. Config Server : used fot Git, SVN and other version control systems
4. Import the existing Maven project and proceed. if you run the app, the app won't run due to port clashes. By default the micro
   service would try and run on port 8080, which is alreayd in use by our limit-service. So we need to alter the port
   of the current microservice to 8888.
   Go to application.properties and write the following command
   server.port=8888

5. Also we change the name of the application via application.properties:
   spring.application.name = spring-cloud-config-server
