1. Consumer First
2. Proper documentation via Swagger
3. Use proper protocols such as GET, DELETE, POST
4. Response Status:

200 : Success
404 : Resource Not Found
400 : Bad Request
201 : Created
401 : Unauthorized
500 : Server Error

5. Always use plurals in the URI.
   /user wrong
   /users correct

6. When you think of Resources, always think in terms of noun and not verb.
   Eg: user Ok
      deleteuser not ok
