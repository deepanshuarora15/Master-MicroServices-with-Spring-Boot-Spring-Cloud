1. Web Services are complicated. Micro servcies are even more complicated then those.
2. Problem: There is no one standard definition of microservices.
3. Microservices is nothing but a combination of :
   a. REST Web Services
   b. Small well chosen deployment Units with very well thought through boundaries.
   c. & cloud enabled
4. All of these microservices can interact with each other. It's not compulsory for them to do so, though.
5. Each of these microservices, then has multiple instances, which can be deployed in hassle free manner.
   they can also be destructed/torn-down without any big challenge.
