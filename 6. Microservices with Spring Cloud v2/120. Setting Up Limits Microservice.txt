1. Create a new Spring initialzr project and call it 'limits-service' with dependencies:
   a. Spring Web
   b. Spring Boot DevTools : helps with live reloads
   c. Spring Boot Actuator
   d. Config Client : required to speak to config server
2. Set up the exisiting Maven project like earlier.
3. Make sure that your project full qualified address does not contain any whitespaces, as it might cause issues with Spring cofig.
4. As we have made use Spring config client, we need to add the following command to application.properties:
   spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
   We chose port 8888 as we plan ti run the config server on port 8888 later.
5. Optional here means that we are not gonna be connecting to the server right now. Once we are ready with all the setups, then only are
   we gonna be using it.

6. Imp: As we have added COnfig client in the dependencies of 'limit-service', as a result of that it is compulsory to follow step4.
   You cannot run the app without giving the Spring config server details in the application.properties now.
