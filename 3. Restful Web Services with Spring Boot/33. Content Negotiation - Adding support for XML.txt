1. By default, we get response in JSON formats.
2. To have support for XML as well, we have the following dependency to be added to pom.xml:

<dependency>
			<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
			<artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
		</dependency>

3. To verify, use POSTMAN and while sending in a 'GET' request. Add 'Headers' and select 'Key' - 'Accept'
   and set value to 'application/xml'
