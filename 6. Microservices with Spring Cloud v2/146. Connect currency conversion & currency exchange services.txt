1. In this step we need to register our existing services with the Naming server.
2. Add this dependency to your services:


<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
		</dependency>


3. Imp: after this , first start the naming-server and then start other microservices.
4. On visiting http://localhost:8761/
   we would see that our services are registered. hence the only thing required to register our services with Eureka is
   to add dependencies in microservices pom.xml
5. However, the following step should also be added to the application.properties of all microservices as well:
   eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
6. Everytime we shutdown the app and restart it, the microservice first gets de-registered from the Naming Server.
   And then it gets re-regsitered.
