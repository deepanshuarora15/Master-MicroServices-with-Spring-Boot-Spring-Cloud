2. Spring cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems.
3. Spring cloud is not a project but an umbrella which houses a lot of projects under it. Eg: Spring cloud netflix is one
   of the projects under Spring Cloud
4. Challenges discusses earlier and their corresponding solutions under Spring cloud:
   a. Configuration management: Spring cloud config server allows configuration of all instances of all microservices to be stored
      in the centralized git repository. As all configuration is stored in one place - it's easy to manage now.
   b. Dynamic Scale up and Scale Down: Ribbon is the load balancer to balance load between multiple instances. Ribbon is client
      side load balancing
   c. Visibility & Monitoring: Zipkin Distributed Tracing. 
      Also there are some common features among all microservcies like Security, Analytics etc. Instead of implementing these common
      features repeatedly ourselves, we can rather use Netflix Zuel API Gateway.
   d. Fault Tolerance: Hystrix. It helps us to define a default response in case a microservice goes down
