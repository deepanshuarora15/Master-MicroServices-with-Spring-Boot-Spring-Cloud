1. The main goal of Spring Boot is to develop production ready applications - quickly.
2. Another goal is to provide common non-functional features:
   a. Embedded servers
   b. Metrics
   c. Health checks
   d. Externalized Configuration
3. What Spring Boot is not?
   a. It is not a code generation platform. It generates no code at all.
   b. It is neither an application server, nor a web server.
4. Features of Spring Boot are:
   a. Quick starter projects with auto configuration.
      - With this Spring Web , Spring Core, Spring MVC, a validation framework and a logging framework all come in-built
   b. JPA
   c. Embedded Servers: Earlier we used to install a Linux box, then install java on it and then finally install a web server on it
      such as Tomcat. Then you would take your web application WAR and deploy it on the server.	
      But with Spring boot, we just need a Linux box with Java installed and we can run our app directly on it, as the web server
      like Tomcat already comes bundled inside the Spring Boot application.
   d. Production-ready features:
      1. Metrics & health checks: Spring Boot actuator
      2. Externalized configuration:
