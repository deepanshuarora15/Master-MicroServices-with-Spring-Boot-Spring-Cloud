1. CurrencyExchangeProxy.java

//@FeignClient(name="currency-exchange" , url="localhost:8000") replace this line with:
@FeignClient(name="currency-exchange")

2. Now for the currrency-exchange service, start it on other port.
   Run -> Run Configurations -> Environment -> Add Variable Server.port=8081

3. 

Ok, now when we run the application
http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

then we see the port is switching regularly between 8000 and 8001 , which reflects that load balancing is taking place.
This is client side load balancing and is done by Feign.
ConversionService has a load balancer that is in touch with Eureka naming server.
