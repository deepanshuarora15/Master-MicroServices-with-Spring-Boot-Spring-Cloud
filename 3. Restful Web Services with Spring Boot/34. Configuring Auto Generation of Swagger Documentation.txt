1. We need to provide some documentation to the user, something like Service Definition or API contract.
2. One way is to manually generate the documentation. Other way out is to use automation : open API specification.
   Documentation of the API is automatically generated from the API that you construct via Spring Boot.
3. We would be using the framework: OpenAPI3 
4. Get the dependency configuration from springdoc website.
5. localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
6. This html page is called Swagger UI. It contains the HTTP protocols along with 'resources'. 
7. At the bottom, the classes/beans are also present.
8. API docs link is there in the Swagger UI html page itself.
