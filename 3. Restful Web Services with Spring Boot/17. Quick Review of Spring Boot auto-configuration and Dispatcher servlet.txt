1. application.properties file, we can add the following command to open the application in debug mode

logging.level.org.springframework = debug;

2. When you save it, a lot of logs come in console. In there it is written, auto-configuration report. Under that report,
   a. DispatcherServletConfiguration
   b. ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration : This is what generates the whitelabel error text in browser, whenever an error crops up.
   c. HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration: Responsible for converting Bean to JSON	
   d. JacksonAutoConfiguration: JSON to Bean and Bean to JSON conversion

3. All these are searched by Spring Boot. SB finds out that ok, all these jar files or dependencies are set on the 'home' path
   variable and hence SB auto configuration picks them up automatically for doing the configuration.
4. Q: Who is configuring the Dispatcher Servlet?
   A: SB auto-configuration
5. Q: How does bean get converted to JSON?
   A: HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration & JacksonAutoConfiguration
6. Q: Who is configuring the error mapping?
   A: SB itself via ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration 
7. Dispatcher Servlet follows a design pattern knows as 'Front Controller'. So Dispatcher Servlet is nothing but a front controller.
   Whenever there is call like localhost:8080/Hello, the requests first goes & hits the Dispatcher Servlet.
   Dispatcher servlet handles the root i.e. '/'
8. Dispatcher Servlet maps the request to the right Controller. 
9. So request -> Dispatcher Servlet -> Controller.
10. The above is the mechanism for Request. What's the machanism for Repsonse?
11. @RestController is written on the top of the controller class. One of the annotations inside the @RestController is @ResponseBody.
    After this the converters like HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration & JacksonAutoConfiguration come into picture & eventually
    the response is returned.
