1. Step 1 was to connect our Spring cloud config server to the github repo.
2. In step2 we are gonna be connecting Limits microservices to Spring cloud config server.
3. The diagram for the same is given as page 16 of the pdf.
4. We have already added some configurations in our limits-service that would hep us communicate with our cloud config.

<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
		</dependency>


5. spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888

We have added this line in the limits microservice application.properties, so it can connect to spring cloud config server.
If we remvoe the optional keyword, then it will always madanatroily connect to the server.

6. Imp: The most imp step is to add the following command inside the application.properties file
   spring.application.name=limits-service

7. Make sure to start the config server first and then limits server, to see the changes.

http://localhost:8888/limits-service/default
http://localhost:8080/limits
