1. Deployment of microservices becomes complex especially when different microservices of your project have been developed using
   different programming languages and framework.
2. Problem: with the above situation, we would be having different deployment scheme for different services - which is confusing & 
   cumbersome.
3. We need one common way of deploying all microservices irrespective of the tech that they have been built-on.
4. Solution : containers. Most popular one of them is docker.
5. We can create docker images for each of the microservcies that we have.
6. Docker contains everything that a microservice requires to run:
   a. Application Runtime : JDK/Python?Node js etc
   b. Application Code
   c. Dependencies
7. Once your above docker machine is configured & ready, then it can be run anywhere : your local machine, corporate data center, 
   cloud, GCP, Azure or whatever
